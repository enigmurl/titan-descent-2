     *
     * @param vertices an array of positions in the form of {x1,y1,z1,x2,y2,z2...,xn,yn,zn}. Rather than repeating
     *                  vertices, which takes lots of data, repeat the indices in the second parameter. This is where each
     *                  vertex is in model space.
     * @param textureCords an array of 2d positions in the form of {u1,v1,u2,v2...un,vn}. Also referred to as, uv coordinates
     *                     or s-t coordinates. Essentially they map each vertex to a point in 2d space, which is then
     *                     interpolated so each pixel falls on a 2d area, which we define to be our texture later on.
     *                     Note that unless you know what you're doing (such as tiling), leave the stuff between 0 and 1.
     *                     Also note that (0,0) indicates top left, and (1,1) indicates bottom right.
     * @param indices an int[] of indexes. Each element should correspond to a vertex, that is
     *                if the first element of the index array is 2, it is corresponding to vertices[2]
     *                this is useful when each vertex is comprised of lots of data
